# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
I think it is easier and more complicated than java in different ways, easier because you can write 1 line of code to do the same thing as 10 in java and most of the commands are self explaintory with their names, but its going to be harder because I already know java and transitioning to coding in python might be a challenge.


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Last year I took APCSP and we learned the basics of coding in java, the biggest difference that I have already had issues with is the spacing or like 'tab' because in java it didnt really matter aside from orginization where you had code alligned but with python it does matter and can cause issues that dont pop up in the 'problems' tab.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I learned about spacing with tab so that code is in the correct loops and commands. I also learned about elif which wansnt a thing in java.
